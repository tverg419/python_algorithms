*Start Curated List of Top 75 LeetCode Questions*

**Problem:** #1 Two Sum

**Solution**
- Utilize a dictionary to store each value in the array
    - key => value from array
    - value => target - value from array
- Check the dictionary and return the pair

**Notes**
- Traversing through an array
- Use a dictionary to retain information

**Problem:** #371 Sum of Two Integers

**Solution**
- Utilize AND operator to handle carrying a digit over
- Utilize XOR (exclusive OR) operator to handle addition of bits
- Lastly, utilize left shift operator to carry bits over left

**Notes**
- Understanding bit shifting/manipulation
- Number basing (binary is number base 2)
- Understanding computational differences between base 10 operations and base 2 operations
- Utilize bitwise operators
    - AND(&), XOR(^), Left Shift (<<)

### December 22, 2021

**Problem:** #70 Climbing Stairs

**Solution**
- break the problem down into smaller steps
    - Ex. Step 5 is the summation of the decisions of Step 4(1-Step) & Step 3(2-Step)
    - Similarly, Step 4 is the summation of the decisions of Step 3(1-Step) & Step 2(2-Step)
- this turns the problem into a recursion problem
- our bases cases are Step(0) = 1 and Step(1) = 1

**Notes**
- recognize the problem is a dynamic programming question
- a more efficient solutions is to store the values in a list and call the list instead of redoing the calculation
